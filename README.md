# Data-Project
This is a project of webscraping job postings from Indeed. There is much more I'd like to do with this project but so far, it's starting off small. See below for plans (may or may not already have been done). This project is made not only to learn what can be done with technology but also to have more control over what I can search when looking for jobs. I'm hoping to decrease the amount of time for job searching thorugh this project.

- WebScrape job postings from indeed (Complete)
    Job title, company, company's rating, job location, salary, days posted, remote or not, new job or not, if the job is urgently hiring and job posting's url.
- Add results to excel spreadsheet (Complete)
- Add "minimum experience", "maximum experience" and "job skills" columns to results (Complete)
- Load these results into a database
- Create a report of the job postings
- Create a SQL job to automate table refresh and reporting
